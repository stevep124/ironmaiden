Here is my Iron Maiden Appliction

Please checkout the repository into a folder, and run **npm install** followed by **bower install**

then **cd** to that folder on the command line

then run **node app.js**

finally visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser of choice to see it in action

Thanks

Steve
